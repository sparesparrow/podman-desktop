## Introduction

The MCP Server Manager extension introduces a robust mechanism for launching and managing MCP server containers within Podman Desktop. It offers:

- **Container-based isolation:** Each MCP server runs in its own container for improved reliability and security.
- **Dynamic server management:** Users can add, start, stop, and remove servers through an integrated chat interface.
- **Secure API integration:** Implements Anthropic API access via a dedicated client service with secure key storage.
- **Modular design:** Core business logic is separated from UI components, following SOLID and KISS principles.
