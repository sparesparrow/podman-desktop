# User Interface Documentation

## Overview

The Chat Interface (implemented in `ChatInterface.svelte`) is the primary interaction point for users. It provides a responsive, chat-like experience and dynamically displays the status of MCP servers.

## Design Philosophy

- **Intuitive Layout:** Clear display of messages, server icons, and status indicators.
- **Responsiveness:** Uses Svelte's reactive stores to update state seamlessly.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard interactions (e.g., `on:keydown` for server selection).

## Core Components

- **Server List:** Dynamically lists available MCP servers with visual status cues.
- **Message History:** Scrollable area displaying the conversation flow.
- **Loading Indicators:** Provides feedback while data or servers are being loaded.

## Code Highlights

- The component uses conditional rendering (`{#if loading} ... {:else} ... {/if}`) to switch between loading states and the main chat view.
- CSS variables ensure that both light and dark themes are supported consistently throughout the extension.
