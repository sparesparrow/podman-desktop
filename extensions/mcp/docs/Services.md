# Services Integration Documentation

## Overview

This section covers the integration and functionality of the core services that power the MCP extension:

- **Anthropic Client:** Manages LLM operations and secure API key retrieval.
- **MCP Client Service:** Handles generic MCP protocol commands and communications.
- **Container Manager:** Coordinates container creation, command execution, and lifecycle events.
- **Ambient and Type Declarations:** Facilitate type safety and smooth interoperation between modules.

## Anthropic Client

- **File:** `AnthropicClient.ts`
- **Purpose:** Implements the `ILLMProvider` interface and integrates the Anthropic SDK.
- **Key Methods:**
  - `initialize()` – Retrieves the API key from secure storage.
  - `sendRequest()` – Sends LLM requests with proper error handling.

**Code Reference:**  
Review how error handling is wrapped around asynchronous API calls (e.g., lines 23–31).

## MCP Client Service

- **File:** `McpClient.ts`
- **Purpose:** Provides a wrapper around the core MCP client logic using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- **Key Features:**
  - Connection management
  - Robust error handling around notifications and requests

## Container Manager

- **File:** `ContainerManager.ts`
- **Purpose:** Manages lifecycle operations such as container creation, start, stop, and command execution.
- **Implementation Note:** Uses a fake container class (`FakeContainer`) for simulation and testing.

## Type Declarations

- **Files:** `ambient.d.ts` and `interfaces.ts`
- **Purpose:** Define types for transports, containers, configuration, and client operations. This ensures type safety across the project.
