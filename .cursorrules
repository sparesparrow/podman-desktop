  "projectContext": "MCP Server Manager Extension for Podman Desktop",
  "overview": "This project implements an MCP Server Manager as a Podman Desktop extension. It serves as a central coordination point for MCP servers by handling their lifecycle management and communication within containers. Based on a JSON configuration, each defined MCP server is instantiated in its own container, and the UI displays an icon for each. Users can also add new servers dynamically via the chat interface. The design adheres to SOLID and KISS principles, employs dependency injection and MVC patterns, and ensures that business logic is separated from UI components.",
  "codingStandards": {
    "general": [
      "Follow SOLID principles – every module or class must have a single responsibility.",
      "Keep the design simple (KISS) and modular.",
